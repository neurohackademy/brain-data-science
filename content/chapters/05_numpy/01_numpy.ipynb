    "Data from neuroscience experiments is often stored in big tables of data called arrays. Much like Python lists or tuples, the items in an array follow a particular order. But in contrast to a list or a tuple, they can have multiple dimensions: these arrays can have one dimension (for example a time-series from a single channel of an EEG recording), two dimensions (for example all the time-series from multiple EEG channels recorded simultaneously), three dimensions (for example, an anatomical scan of a human brain), four dimensions (for example, an fMRI dataset with the three spatial dimensions and volumes arranged as a series along the last dimension) or more.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In all these cases, the arrays are *continuous*. That means that there are no holes in an array, where nothing is storred. They are also *homogeneous*, which means that all of the items in an array are of the same data type (XXX need to come back and see whether we have defined data types by this point). That is, if one number stored in the array is a floating point number, all numbers in the array will be represented in their floating point representation.\n",
