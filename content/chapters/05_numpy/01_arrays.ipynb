    "Data from neuroscience experiments is often stored in big tables of data called arrays. Much like Python lists or tuples, the items in an array follow a particular order. But in contrast to a list or a tuple, they can have multiple dimensions: these arrays can have one dimension (for example a time-series from a single channel of an EEG recording), two dimensions (for example all the time-series from multiple EEG channels recorded simultaneously), three dimensions (for example, an anatomical scan of a human brain), four dimensions (for example, an fMRI dataset with the three spatial dimensions and volumes arranged as a series along the last dimension) or more.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In all these cases, the arrays are *continuous*. That means that there are no holes in an array, where nothing is storred. They are also *homogeneous*, which means that all of the items in an array are of the same data type (XXX need to come back and see whether we have defined data types by this point). That is, if one number stored in the array is a floating point number, all numbers in the array will be represented in their floating point representation. It also means that the dimensions of the array are predictable. If the first channel of the EEG time-series has 20,000 time-points in it, the second channel would also have 20,000 time-points in it. If the first slice of an MRI image has 64-by-64 voxels, other slices in the MRI image would also have 64-by-64 voxels.\n",

    "As we'll see in a few of the examples to follow, arrays simplify some computations. They also make a lot of computations go much faster. Let's start with how you would create an array and assign it to a variable."

All of the items in this array are integers, so we can use an integer representation as the dtype of the array. This means that each element of the array takes up 8 bytes of memory. Using the 64-bit integers, we can represent the numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. And each one would take up 8 bytes of memory in our computer (which are 64 bits). This also explains the strides. Strides are the number of bytes in memory that we would have to skip to get to the next value in the array. Because the array is packed densly in a contiguous bit of memory, to get from the value `1` to the value `2`, for example, we have to skip 8 bytes.\n",

You can also think of that as rows (2 rows) and columns (5 columns), because each item in the first row of the array has an item matching it in terms of its column in the second row. For example, the number `2` in the first row is equivalent to the number `21` in the second row in that they are both the third item in their particular rows. Or, in other words, they share the third column in the array. The items are still each 8 bytes in size, but now there are two items in the strides: `(40, 8)`.
